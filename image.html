        <p>Digital Imaging is the most important element for the Multimedia field, for instanceIt allows for the integration of various media formats like text, audio, video, and images within a single platform, creating a richer, more engaging experience compared to just static images alone; this is particularly valuable for conveying complex information, enhancing user interaction, and adding depth to presentations across diverse fields like education, entertainment, and communication. Graphic design is a process that combines words and images to convey ideas. It's done by professionals called graphic designers and used in fields like advertising. Image-making is very important to graphic design. It's an effective way to catch people's attention and make connections with viewers.</p>
        <p>There are programs which developed digital imaging, for instance, Adobe Photoshop, is used to crop or edit photos, making digital art, collage, removing objects, and adjusting lighting. Photoshop is where editors and graphic designers can make their own projects look imaginable.</p>

        <p>Here's my image project which is done with Adobe Photoshop. This image show how I've place numerous image parts into a full collage altogether with using images, downloaded from Pexels under it's the company's own License which were free to use, crop and edit, and give credit to the owners of these images.</p>
        <p>I've placed the "Statue of Liberty" for the full background around 8.5 x 11 inch with a vertical orientation. Then also adding small parts of images like "Small Propeller Plane," "Hot Air Balloon 1" or "2," and the "Birds" with using the Object selection Tool with Lasso that I can circle around these objects and then copy and paste into the image background, and duplicate that fit into the skies's part of the background Then, there's the "Egale" in the front, while the "Moon" appeared in the back and use the layer mask and belending to make the moon to have less fill and it's opacity.</p>
        <p>I also added two main images in the bottom front, for example the "Whale" appears from the ocean, and the "Penguin" standing top of an iceberg, which both make to visualze of people or tourists from the Liberty Island to see a great view of these two sea animals. It's just how I can create image projects with using images that were consider public domain or a license from Creative Commons or a free Pexels website, and expressed the emotions and the visualizations to the audience around, that someday I'll be useful around the multimedia and graphic design industry.</p>
