        <p>Audio is the most important element around multimedia, like audio, sounds is used to enhances the views of emotions to attracts the audienceâ€™s experiences by setting into a tone through music, sound effects, voiceovers, and ambient sounds that sets through into a story and further into realism that can invoke a strong atmosphere to make the audience feel more connected and supported from an auditory experience.</p>
        <p>In multimedia design, sound design can craft a narrative that resonates emotionally with audiences, demonstrating the power of sound in multimedia. For instance, Audacity, a free open software was used to design for audio production, with a few key steps and with basic tools which easily to increase your audio, and also helps build skills in audio editing, recording, and manipulation, allowing users to develop technical proficiency in sound manipulation, creativity in audio projects, and critical listening abilities, particularly useful for podcasting, music production, language learning, and content creation.</p>

            <p>I've begun developing audio production projects with using Audacity. For instance, the "City Background Invasion," I've developed with using Audacity and the recorded audio files that I've used for this project were downloaded from Freesound.org, Licensed under Creative Commons.</p>
            <p>This audio project was been organized, added effects (Reverb) & (Brass and Treble) with Audacity, for example the "Apoambient.wav" for dark ambient music background while playing "Storms.wav" and "Crowd Screaming" in the background, as I visualize this description as people screaming slowly where their city was faced an invasion, while additional auido like "Explosions.wav" and "Sirens.wav" duplicately. For reasons why I developed this audio project, not just to gain exprience, it genrate expressions from the audience, when listening these audio projects from films, video games, and televisions, to make them entertain. For me, I'll be useful to make audio and Foley projects more dynamic. </p>
