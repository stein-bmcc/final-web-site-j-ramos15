        <p>Animation is known for the elementt around multimedia field that gives the illusion of moving and manipulating pictures or images in sequence matter. Animation is crucial in multimedia because it allows for clear, engaging, and impactful communication of ideas by visually presenting information in a dynamic way, making it easier for audiences to understand complex concepts, retain information, and feel more connected to the content, particularly in areas like marketing, education, and entertainment; essentially, animation adds life and visual appeal to multimedia projects, capturing attention and leaving a lasting impression.</p>
        <p>Animation is consider a great career that can be creative and earn good money, as you gain more knowledge and experience and build your portoflio, a career aniamtion can be successful around the animation and multimedia industry.</p>
        <p>To begin starting to do animation with Adobe After Effects,  a digital visual effects and motion graphics application was used to create special effects, video graphics, and 2D animation, and also it can imported illustrated images and vectors from Adobe Illustrator that benefit your animation project and your portfolio.</p>

        <h2>Balloon Skies (Night/Day)</h2>
        <h3>Animated by JG Ramos</h3>
        <p>Here's this 15-second animation clip that I've done with using Adobe After Effects to use these illustrated images and vectors from Adobe Illustrator, this clip demostrate the time-lapse started from night to morning and slowly ended with hot air balloons appearing in the front as the city's skyscrapers are behind the backround.</p>
        <p>First was using Adobe Illustrator to make background colors for the day and night, then there's vector images like three separate skyscrapers with windows whether its lights on or off, then there's the moon and the sun. Also for the small vector objects like "airplanes," a "flying saucer," then, a "Zeppelin, then lastly, the "hot air ballons" with three different designs.</p>
        <p>Second, I've imported these images into After Effects, then organize the iamge layer on where you want to put the image in front or the back. </p>
        <p>Lastly, is use the transform on each image layer whether is the image manipulate with Position or Opacity, and use the stopwatch and the keyframe to set parameters for motion & other properties for it's image. It takes time to organize and correct it properly. </p>
        <p>This animation clip shows that I've used the opacity to fade out the night background as the day background appear seconds before, then change the skyscrapers color from black to gray, and the lights had turn off when the morning appears seconds later. Then, I used the position use to have the airplane, flying saucer, Zeppelin, also including the moon and the sun into motion behind the skyscraper. Then, the clip concluded with nine hot air balloons with three different designs appear in the front of the skyscrapers.</p>
        <p>Based upon this animation clip, I just how I have much capability besides imaging, even though this clip was the first part of expanding my animation and After Effects skills, to make digital images, text, shapes and vectors into motion. Also, it brings the ability to manipulate layers, add dynamic motion to graphics, and integrate visual effects seamlessly into video footage, making your projects visually engaging and professional.</p>
